  // useNavigate() should only be used for side effects â€” like in response to a user action (e.g., button click) or inside a useEffect. 
  // A component must always return JSX, not imperatively call navigation during render.
  
  // main take ways is AuthLayout is a component must return a JSX, so when we return <Navigate to="/dashboard" replace /> no futher execution is done and we are rendering a new component called <Navigate> it will remove this componet for component tree
